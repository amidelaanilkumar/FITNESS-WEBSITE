Strong arms are important for almost every upper body movement you do each day and your triceps are often the heavy lifters. 
Anytime you push something—whether it be a door, a stroller, a lawnmower, or a barbell—you're using your triceps.

            Strength is important and, for many of us, so is having toned arms. In other words, most of us don't like it when our triceps keep waving even after we've stopped.<br><br>
            The triceps, as the name suggests, has three different heads: the long head, lateral head, and the medial head. All of these heads contract during triceps exercises,
             but some moves emphasize different parts of the triceps.
              The best way to build strong, firm triceps is to choose the exercises that hit all those muscle fibers from every angle.<br>

                Some triceps exercises are more effective than others, something we know from the American Council on Exercise.
                In an ACE-commissioned study, researchers took exercisers through eight of the most common triceps exercises and recorded muscle activity by attaching EMG electrodes to their triceps.1
                With this information, they were able to rank the eight best triceps exercises. <br><br>The top five moves:

                The diamond push-up is probably the hardest triceps exercise in this list. It requires tremendous upper body strength, so you may need to try this move on your knees and slowly work your way up to the toes.<br>
              <h3> How to Do a Diamond Push-Up</h3><br>

                <ol><li>Begin the move by positioning the hands on the mat directly under the chest with the fingers spread and the thumbs and forefingers touching, making a diamond shape.
                  <li>Straighten the legs into a plank position (harder) or keep the knees on the floor for an easier version.
                    <li>Make sure the back is flat and the abs are engaged as you bend the elbows, lowering until your chin or chest touches the mat. If you can't go that low, go as low as you can—then work to build enough strength to lower all the way down over time.
                    <li>At the bottom of the movement, your elbows should stay in close to your sides.
                    <li>Press back to start keeping the torso rigid and repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</ol><br></div>

                The kickback is the second most effective triceps exercise and not far behind diamond push-ups, coming in at about 88% of muscle activation.
                By bending forward, you really have to work against gravity to move the weight up and down. The key to this move is to use your shoulder to stabilize the upper arm, allowing the forearm to extend behind you. If you feel your elbow drifting down, use a lighter weight to keep good form.

                    <ol><li>	Prop the right foot on a step or platform, resting the right forearm on the thigh to support the back.</li>
                <li>	Hold a weight in the left hand and pull the elbow up to torso level.</li>
                <li>	Keeping the elbow in that position, extend the arm behind you, focusing on contracting the triceps.</li>
                <li>	Lower the forearm down to about 90 degrees and repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</li>
                <li>	Focus on keeping the upper arm stationary against the body throughout the exercise.</li></ol></div>

                Dips are the third most effective exercise and a tough one depending on how you position your feet. In this version, the knees are bent, making the exercise easier. Extending your feet out will increase the intensity of the exercise.
                The key to keeping this move safe is to keep your hips close to the chair or bench to avoid straining the shoulders. Make sure you keep the shoulders down and away from the ears and, if you feel any discomfort in the shoulders, skip this exercise.<br>

                    <ol><li>	Sit on a chair or bench with hands just outside of the hips and the knees bent or the legs extended straight out (harder).</li>
                <li>	Lift up onto the hands and, keeping the hips very close to the chair or bench, bend the elbows, lowering down until they're at about 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>	Keep the elbows pointing behind you, the shoulders down and the abs engaged.</li>
                <li>	Push back to start and repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</li>

                The overhead triceps extension is the fourth most effective triceps exercise, coming in at about 76% of muscle activation. The key to this exercise is to keep the arms next to the ears as you lower the weight behind you. Make sure you can contract the abs to keep your back from arching.
                You can do this exercise seated, as shown, or standing. Believe it or not, this move actually feels harder when you're sitting, and sitting on an exercise ball adds an element of core strength.<br>

                Barbell triceps extensions (or what we often call skull crushers for obvious reasons), come in at a surprising number seven, eliciting about 62% muscle activation. Some exercisers will find this comparatively low activation rate surprising because this exercise is known for being challenging.
                The muscle activation data doesn't mean you shouldn't do these anymore, but rather that you should work them into a program that includes some of the top exercises as well. Using a variety of exercises that tackle different muscles at different intensities will lead to better results and stronger triceps.<br>

                <li>	Bend the elbows and lower the weight until the elbows are at about 90-degree angles. This would be the part where you wouldn't want to crush your skull by going too low.</li>
