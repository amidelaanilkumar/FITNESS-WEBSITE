                        <p>A barbell overhead shoulder press (aka barbell standing shoulder press) works not just your shoulders, but most of your body. That makes it a terrific core strengthener and mass builder, among other things. To start.<br>

                                <ol> <li>	Put your feet at shoulder-width, and tighten your core as you hold a barbell at your shoulders, palms facing forward.</li>
                            <li>	Next, push the bar upward and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the peak.</li>
                            <li>	Lower steadily and carefully.</li></ol></div> <br></p>

                        <p> A proper deltoid workout simply isn’t complete without the seated dumbbell shoulder press. In fact, some say this exercise routine is an entire deltoid regimen unto itself, targeting the anterior, lateral, and posterior deltoid muscles (with an emphasis on the middle delts). Meanwhile, lifting two separate dumbbells (as opposed to using a machine) prevents you from using one side of your body over the other, thereby retaining firmer balance and distribution. Naturally, a fair amount of coordination is required to pull this one off, especially when you increase the weights. <br><br>

                                 <ol><li>	Sit on a low-back bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand at the shoulder level, palms facing forward.</li>
                             <li>	Keeping your head and spine perfectly straight, lift the dumbbells overhead toward one another, stopping just short of having them touch at the top.</li>
                             <li>	Hold the position for a few seconds and then carefully reverse course. Repeat.</li></ol></div><br></p>

                        <p> You can use either a weight plate or barbell for this shoulder exercise, which targets the anterior delts. No matter what you decide to use, prepare for a seriously intense workout that brings no shortage of healthy pain. For that reason, don’t max out on the weight, as it will quickly turn healthy pain into unhealthy injury. <br><br>

                             <li>  Next, retract your shoulder blades and keep your arms straight as you lift the weight to shoulder level.</li>

                                    <li>	Now, bend over until your core is basically parallel with the ground, and hang the dumbbells directly underneath you, all while keeping your elbows in a slightly bent position.</li>
                                    <li>	Next, raise both dumbbells up and out to your sides, forming an arc until your upper arms are even with your torso.</li>
                                    <li>	Take a brief pause at the top before lowering the dumbbells back into starting position.</li>
