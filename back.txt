            Too many guys approach life with too a narrow focus, only caring about what they see in front of them. This rings true at work, in their relationships, and even with their workouts, as they spend hour after hour repeating the same front-focused movements in an effort to create changes they can see immediately reflected in a mirror.

            This forward-gazing approach might not be as beneficial to the arms, abs, and chest as you might think. To truly build a big, strong, torso, you can't forget about what's on the other side. If you're never dedicating time and energy to working your back, you'll throw your body's balance out of whack.
            <br><br>
            Flipping the script on your training plan is more important than just checking another box on your to-do list. A big chest looks ridiculous (and doesn't physically function all that well) without a big upper back and shoulders. Likewise, your abs are part of your core, whose role is ultimately to support your spine. For better function and aesthetics, your mid and lower back need attention, too. And no one wants to exhibit poor posture when they look at themselves in the mirror—so the postural correction that comes from strong, activated back muscles is important, too.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, your back muscles can play a bigger role than you might expect in assisting big-time compound movements that pay off in spades, like the bench press. Your upper- and mid-back muscles help to stabilize your shoulder joints, and the stronger and more stable your shoulders, the more weight you can lift in just about every upper-body exercise. Your hands have to be involved in back-focused exercises to handle the load, too, so don't be surprised when all those rows result in bigger arm muscles.

                The following workout routines don't include warm-up sets. Do as many warm-up reps as you need, but never take warm-ups to muscle failure.
                Choose a weight that allows you to reach muscle failure by the target rep listed in the workout.
                Keep your form tight, and never allow your lower back to round.
                Use a weight belt for deadlifts and rows, and wrist straps to reinforce your grip.</div>  hy

                        Working your back using just your bodyweight is tough. Short of pullups or inverted rows, you're pretty much out of luck—aside from this heroic exercise that torches your mid and upper back muscles. The simple movement can be more difficult than you might expect, so make sure you go slow and know what you're doing before you get down on the floor to fly<br>
                        DO THIS: Get on the floor on your belly. Squeeze your glutes to raise your feet and legs, engage your mid back, and squeeze your shoulder blades to raise your arms off the floor in an extended position. Focus on firing your entire posterior chain to begin the movement—your lower back shouldn't take all the strain.<br><br>
    Keep your neck in a neutral position and avoid looking up. Hold the top position for a two count before lowering back to the ground. Make sure to move at a measured pace through a set.

                        You'll get used to the row in its many forms if you're working on your back—so start out with a light-resistance version that can serve as a warmup or a key part of your routine. The band will allow you to work through the range of motion without breaking out the weights, while still challenging you with some resistance. .<br><br>
    
                        DO THIS: Grab a low-resistance band and set it out on the ground. Stand on the middle of the band, grabbing the two ends in either hand with a pronated (overhand) grip, hinging at the hips and slightly bending your knees in an athletic stance. Make sure that your back isn't rounded. .<br><br>
                        
                        Squeeze your back to pull the band ends simultaneously to your chest, or as close as the band allows. Pause for a moment at the top of the motion, then slowly return to the original position, working against the band's resistance.

                        The renegade row is all about maximizing the utility of a position to the highest degree. Take two high bang-for-your-buck moves, like the plank and pushup, and make them even useful by adding more elements to work different muscle groups. Work with light dumbbells here — maintaining the proper spinal position is just as important and rowing the weight. .<br><br>
    
                        DO THIS: Grab a pair of light dumbbells and about as much space as you would need to perform pushups. Get in a plank position with your feet spread wide, gripping the dumbbells with your palms facing parallel to each other. Squeeze your glutes and core to maintain a strong spinal alignment, looking at the floor ahead of you. .<br><br>
                        
                        Use your lats to row one of the dumbbells to chest height, then return the weight to the ground, keeping the rest of your body balanced in its position. Control the load up and down the movement — if you have to contort your body and shift your back to lift the dumbbells, drop down to a lower weight. Perform a pushup, maintaining spinal alignment, and repeat the motion with the opposite arm.

                        Dumbbell rows are a classic move that should have a place in every self-respecting lifter's heart. Your hinged position will give your lats a chance to shine, while other rear-positioned muscles like the rhomboids and traps will kick in for support. .
    
                        You also have the benefit of working both sides of your body, allowing you to work through weak spots by focusing on building up strength imbalances. .<br><br>
                        
                        DO THIS: You only need one dumbbell to do the job here. Old school heads would require you to mount the bench with your weight on your opposite knee and hand, planting the same side leg on the ground—but if you don't know exactly what you're doing and have full control of the weight, you could be putting your spine in jeopardy. Instead, stand close to the bench, square your feet, and plant your palm on the platform. Bend at the hips, and keep your back straight, picking up the dumbbell with your work hand and allowing it to hang straight down from your shoulder. .<br><br>
                        
                        Pull the dumbbell up to the side of your torso without rotating your shoulders or losing your balance. Pause for a count at the top before lowering the weight to the starting position.

                        If you struggle with keeping your chest strong and your spine straight when you try bent-over exercise variations, you'll love this move. The chest-supported row isolates your back and lets a bench do the work, allowing you to concentrate on moving the weight more efficiently. .<br><br>
    
                        DO THIS: Sit on an incline bench with your chest forward, resting on the support. Grab dumbbells with a neutral grip, keeping your chest strong and allowing your arms to hang. .<br><br>
                        
                        Squeeze your back to pull the weights to your hips, with your elbows bent at 90-degree angles. Squeeze your shoulder blades for one to two seconds maintaining your position, then return to the starting point.
