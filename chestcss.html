                        <p> To start, lay flat on your back, with your feet positioned as far back as they’ll go while still remaining flat on the ground. 
                            Position yourself under the bar so that your hands sit directly above your elbows when gripping the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. 
                            Many weightlifters like to position their pinky or ring fingers on the break in the chrome knurling.
                            Unrack the barbell and breath in as you lower it to your chest, keeping your shoulder blades tight and wrists straight.
                            Let the bar touch your chest, then breathe out and activate your chest to push up and your legs to help support the movement.
                            That’s one rep.<br></p>

                             With your arms extended, grab one handle in each hand, and positioning your body forward so you feel a slight stretch in your arms.
                              Keep your elbows slightly bend, and bring your arms forward, crossing your hands as you complete the movement. 
                              Return your hands to the starting position, ensuring you keep them controlled and feel a constant tension. <br></p>

                            If you’re using heavy weights, you can have a spotter hand you the dumbbells once you’re in position. Keeping your elbows slightly bent, inhale and 
                            lower the dumbbells so your arms are parallel with the ground, making sure to not extend the weights past your shoulders. Exhale and bring them back to the starting position.<br></p>

                        <p>  Position yourself in a high plank to form the top of a pushup position, with your palms flat and hands shoulder-width apart.
                            The key is to keep your body in a straight line, making sure to engage your core throughout the movement. Lower body to the floor,
                             until your chest touches the ground, then press upwards to return to the starting position.<br> <br></p>

                        <p>  To perform dips at home, look for any strong surface that’s elevated from the ground. You can place two sturdy chairs next to each other, 
                            a bit wider than your shoulder width apart. Placing your hands on the seat of each chair, extend your arms to suspend your body above them.
                             Bring yourself down by slowing bending your elbows. <br></p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p> The Smith machine features a barbell fixed on steel rails, allowing you to comfortably lift more weight than you might be able to on a regular barbell
                            since you don’t have to worry about balancing the weight yourself. This is also a useful tool if you’re working out alone and don’t have a spotter,
                             as the Smith machine also features a set of hooks to re-rack the barbell at any height, requiring only a simple turn to secure. 
                             Incline bench exercises help engage the upper chest and shoulders, making them a great addition to a dynamic chest workout.<br></p>
