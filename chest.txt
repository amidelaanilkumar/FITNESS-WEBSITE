                Mondays are renowned in the hardcore workout world as<a href="chest day.html" target="_blank" > International Chest Day</a>.
                Meatheads everywhere kick off the training week with set after set of barbell bench press reps 
                to build up their barrel-shaped bodies,grunting and straining to beat their buddies to being strong enough to
                push the next set of plates. But then, they leave the weight room without hitting a single other implement
                (unless they're heading to the squat rack for a long round of biceps curls, of course).</p>

                    margin-left: 50px;text-align: left;">We're mostly joking about that type of workout, but there are some kernels of truth in the telling.
                 Pushing big weight (and working your way up to pushing big weight) is a worthy endeavor and a great way to stay motivated, 
                 but you shouldn't feel limited to only training your major mirror muscles using that single narrow-minded protocol.
                 <br> <br> 

                There's more to training your chest than just doing presses and pec deck reps until your back fuses with the surface of the platform beneath you
                (hint: you shouldn't only be doing exercises with your back supported by a bench).
                By just staying within those comfortable realms, you're spurning all of the potential benefits that other moves could offer.
                You want to stimulate your muscles in different ways, so you can challenge them to adapt and grow as your training plan progresses. 
                For that, you'll need variety.
                 <br> <br> <br>


                You can train your chest at home or in a pinch with bodyweight moves like pushup variations, feature chest-centric movements in broader
                full-body workouts to spread the workload, and if you feel like you're lagging, even ramp up the volume beyond the Monday standard with 
                multiple sessions dedicated to chest in a week. <br> <br> <br>


                  Here are some of the best chest exercises to do just that. Choose two or three to work into your routine, and for best results, 
                  rotate in new movements every 3 or 4 weeks.
                   Just remember, there's nothing wrong with a big bench for your chest—as long as your workout doesn't start and end there.
                   <br> <br></p>
                   <h1 style="background-color:black;color:cornsilk;"><center>The Best Chest Exercises </center></h1>
                   <div style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
                       If you have access to a gym, you can knock out any of the following exercises. The chest is huge, though, and prone to muscle pulls,
                       so make sure you spend time adequately warming up and easing into heavy lifts. You don’t want to shoot for a bench press record on your first set.
                       We recommend five to 10 minutes of stretching combined with some light resistance bands (more on that later) and simple push-ups to get the blood flowing.
           
                       <p> With chest exercises, safety should be a priority. Many of these have you hoisting hundreds of pounds above your head and neck,
                        so always use a spotter when lifting heavier, and know your limits when lifting alone.</p></div>

                               The be-all-end-all of chest exercises. The foundation of any chest day. The iconic compound lift. We’ll focus on the flat barbell bench press here,
                                though there are tons of variations, like the incline bench press or bench press with dumbbells.<br>
           
                               To start, lay flat on your back, with your feet positioned as far back as they’ll go while still remaining flat on the ground. 
                               Position yourself under the bar so that your hands sit directly above your elbows when gripping the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. 
                               Many weightlifters like to position their pinky or ring fingers on the break in the chrome knurling.
                               Unrack the barbell and breath in as you lower it to your chest, keeping your shoulder blades tight and wrists straight.
                               Let the bar touch your chest, then breathe out and activate your chest to push up and your legs to help support the movement.
                               That’s one rep.<br><br>
                               <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/19/18/5b191878916185659b9f1f12430ca56f.gif" ><img src="bench press(c).jpeg"  style="margin-left:400px;border-color:rgb(245, 234, 217) ;" border="2"></a><br><br>
                               
                               
                               
                               
                               As we said, people love to brag about how much they can bench. Consider it a rite of passage in the bodybuilding community.
                                But don’t let that intimidate you, and more importantly, don’t let that pressure you to lift outside your comfort zone.
                                 Developing a strong chest takes time, so ensure you’re practicing proper form and gradually increasing the weight during your fitness journey. 
                                 When you do lift heavier, we highly recommend recruiting a spotter to make sure you can unrack the barbell comfortably, and rescue you in case you gas out during a set.

                               Cable machines are a great tool for strength workouts, as they provide constant tension throughout whichever exercise you’re achieving.
                                The cable crossover closely mimics the pushing motion of a bench press, but offers more mobility, and (as the name suggests) allows your
                                 arms to cross at the end of the movement.<br><br>
                                 <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b1/43/ea/b143ea5e3d0d6d595307c7451d98657a.gif"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQaXnN8-0C0_hEI8lEn6laLuKtQuVmOVlgzgg&usqp=CAU" style="margin-left:400px;border-color:rgb(245, 234, 217) ;" border="2"></a><br><br>
           
                               To start, set the pulleys of a cable machine to their highest possible position.
                                With your feet staggered, stand in the center of the two cables.
                                 With your arms extended, grab one handle in each hand, and positioning your body forward so you feel a slight stretch in your arms.
                                  Keep your elbows slightly bend, and bring your arms forward, crossing your hands as you complete the movement. 
                                  Return your hands to the starting position, ensuring you keep them controlled and feel a constant tension.  
                           </p>
           
           
                            <h2 id="dumbell fly" style="background-color: rgb(245, 234, 217);color: rgb(94, 35, 142);">Dumbbell Fly:</h2>

                               As you’ve probably gathered by now, chest exercises mostly follow either a push or fly movement. The variations, then, come in which angles and equipment you use.
                                Dumbbells allow your arms to move independently of one another, helping to develop grip strength as you keep the weights controlled throughout the exercise.<br><br>
           
                               Lay on a flat bench (or at the angle of your choice, for a variation), with your arms extended above your chest and dumbbells parallel with your body. 
                               If you’re using heavy weights, you can have a spotter hand you the dumbbells once you’re in position. Keeping your elbows slightly bent, inhale and 
                               lower the dumbbells so your arms are parallel with the ground, making sure to not extend the weights past your shoulders. Exhale and bring them back to the starting position.<br>
                             <br> <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/92/b4/ff92b4cf397618005f6d23dc9f993d7a.gif"> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSISvUc8q-3ohH8H8HS2Ai1WpLj9VGU-FKhAQ&usqp=CAU" style="margin-left:400px;border-color:rgb(245, 234, 217) ;" border="2"></a><br><br>
                               
                               <br>Form is paramount here. Make sure you use a comfortable weight, keep your elbows fixed throughout the exercise and ensure your shoulders don’t get overextended,
                                as these can all minimize the exercise’s effectiveness and lead to injury.</p>

                               Since the best chest exercises are all centered around the “push” motion, it’s no surprise to see the tried-and-true push-up here. As simple as exercises come,
                                the push-up is great for building chest strength, but it also engages your arms, back and core when done properly.<br><br>
           
                               Position yourself in a high plank to form the top of a pushup position, with your palms flat and hands shoulder-width apart.
                                The key is to keep your body in a straight line, making sure to engage your core throughout the movement. Lower body to the floor,
                                 until your chest touches the ground, then press upwards to return to the starting position.<br>
                                <br> <a href="https://media.tenor.com/images/58cc0c7477ea44689ccadb511217f00a/tenor.gif"><img src="push up(c).jpeg" style="margin-left:400px;border-color:rgb(245, 234, 217) ;" border="2"></a><br><br>
                               
                               <br>While push-ups are great and simple, all you’ve got is your bodyweight, so it’s easy to plateau if push-ups are your only chest or upper-body exercise.
                                For added difficulty, you can have a friend or roommate place books on your back. 
                                Try an angled variation with your feet elevated on a chair or table to really target your upper chest.  </p>
           
           
                            <h2 id="dips" style="background-color: rgb(245, 234, 217);color: rgb(94, 35, 142);"> Dips:</h2>

                               Dips are another equipment-free, bodyweight exercise you can do to strengthen your upper body.
                                Though you might feel it most in your triceps, dips offer a great burn in your chest as well.<br><br>
                               <a href="https://365musclefitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/parallel-bar-Dips.gif"> <img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-muscular-man-during-workout-260nw-336330482.jpg" style="margin-left:400px;border-color:rgb(245, 234, 217) ;" border="2"></a><br><br>
           
                               To perform dips at home, look for any strong surface that’s elevated from the ground. You can place two sturdy chairs next to each other, 
                               a bit wider than your shoulder width apart. Placing your hands on the seat of each chair, extend your arms to suspend your body above them.
                                Bring yourself down by slowing bending your elbows.<br></p>

                               The Smith machine features a barbell fixed on steel rails, allowing you to comfortably lift more weight than you might be able to on a regular barbell
                                since you don’t have to worry about balancing the weight yourself. This is also a useful tool if you’re working out alone and don’t have a spotter,
                                 as the Smith machine also features a set of hooks to re-rack the barbell at any height, requiring only a simple turn to secure. 
                                 Incline bench exercises help engage the upper chest and shoulders, making them a great addition to a dynamic chest workout.<br><br>

                                 Sit on an adjustable workout bench positioned at 45 degrees underneath the Smith machine, with the barbell racked so you can reach it with your arms bent.
                                Twist the bar to unrack, breath in and lower it to your chest, breathing out as you push it back up.
