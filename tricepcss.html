                        <p> The diamond push-up is probably the hardest triceps exercise in this list. It requires tremendous upper body strength, so you may need to try this move on your knees and slowly work your way up to the toes.<br>
                            <h3> How to Do a Diamond Push-Up</h3>

                              <ol><li>Begin the move by positioning the hands on the mat directly under the chest with the fingers spread and the thumbs and forefingers touching, making a diamond shape.
                                <li>Straighten the legs into a plank position (harder) or keep the knees on the floor for an easier version.
                                  <li>Make sure the back is flat and the abs are engaged as you bend the elbows, lowering until your chin or chest touches the mat. If you can't go that low, go as low as you can—then work to build enough strength to lower all the way down over time.
                                  <li>At the bottom of the movement, your elbows should stay in close to your sides.
                                  <li>Press back to start keeping the torso rigid and repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</ol><br></div> <br></p>

                        <p> The kickback is the second most effective triceps exercise and not far behind diamond push-ups, coming in at about 88% of muscle activation.
                            By bending forward, you really have to work against gravity to move the weight up and down. The key to this move is to use your shoulder to stabilize the upper arm, allowing the forearm to extend behind you. If you feel your elbow drifting down, use a lighter weight to keep good form.

                                <ol><li>	Prop the right foot on a step or platform, resting the right forearm on the thigh to support the back.</li>
                            <li>	Hold a weight in the left hand and pull the elbow up to torso level.</li>
                            <li>	Keeping the elbow in that position, extend the arm behind you, focusing on contracting the triceps.</li>
                            <li>	Lower the forearm down to about 90 degrees and repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</li>
                            <li>	Focus on keeping the upper arm stationary against the body throughout the exercise.</li></ol></div><br></p>

                        <p>  Dips are the third most effective exercise and a tough one depending on how you position your feet. In this version, the knees are bent, making the exercise easier. Extending your feet out will increase the intensity of the exercise.
                            The key to keeping this move safe is to keep your hips close to the chair or bench to avoid straining the shoulders. Make sure you keep the shoulders down and away from the ears and, if you feel any discomfort in the shoulders, skip this exercise.<br>

                            <li>	Lift up onto the hands and, keeping the hips very close to the chair or bench, bend the elbows, lowering down until they're at about 90 degrees.</li>
                            <li>	Keep the elbows pointing behind you, the shoulders down and the abs engaged.</li>
                            <li>	Push back to start and repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</li>
                            <li>	Avoid this exercise if you feel any pain in the shoulders.</li></ol></div><br></p>

                        <p> The overhead triceps extension is the fourth most effective triceps exercise, coming in at about 76% of muscle activation. The key to this exercise is to keep the arms next to the ears as you lower the weight behind you. Make sure you can contract the abs to keep your back from arching.
                            You can do this exercise seated, as shown, or standing. Believe it or not, this move actually feels harder when you're sitting, and sitting on an exercise ball adds an element of core strength.<br>

                            <li>	Keep your biceps close to your ears and elbows pointing forward as you lower the weight behind your head until the elbows are at about 90-degree angles.</li>
                            <li>	Straighten the arms, contracting the triceps, and then repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</li>

                        <p>  Barbell triceps extensions (or what we often call skull crushers for obvious reasons), come in at a surprising number seven, eliciting about 62% muscle activation. Some exercisers will find this comparatively low activation rate surprising because this exercise is known for being challenging.
                            The muscle activation data doesn't mean you shouldn't do these anymore, but rather that you should work them into a program that includes some of the top exercises as well. Using a variety of exercises that tackle different muscles at different intensities will lead to better results and stronger triceps.<br>

                                <ol> <li>	Lie on a bench, step, or floor and hold the barbell with hands about shoulder-distance apart.</li>
                            <li>	Begin the exercise by extending the weight up over the head, palms facing out and thumbs next to the fingers.</li>
                            <li>	Bend the elbows and lower the weight until the elbows are at about 90-degree angles. This would be the part where you wouldn't want to crush your skull by going too low.</li>
                            <li>	Squeeze the triceps to straighten the arms without locking the joints.</li>
                            <li>	Repeat for 1–3 sets of 8–16 reps.</li></ol></div><br></p>
