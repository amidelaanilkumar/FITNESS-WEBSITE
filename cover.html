                    <p>
                        Though the chest is made up of one single mass of muscle, I find it responds to being trained in three parts: upper, middle, and lower.
                         All three parts respond to the best chest exercises, but from slightly different angles. </p>

                    <h2>bicep</h2>
                    <p> When starting on a muscle-building program, one of the key body parts that many people want to place a large focus on are the biceps.
                        The biceps tend to be a highly noticed muscle group by others, so if you have nicely developed arms, 
                        people are going to know you're on top of your workout game.

                    <h2>tricep</h2>
                    <p>Strong arms are important for almost every upper body movement you do each day and your triceps are often the heavy lifters. 
                        Anytime you push something—whether it be a door, a stroller, a lawnmower, or a barbell—you're using your triceps.

                        If you're never dedicating time and energy to working your back, you'll throw your body's balance out of whack.

                        Few muscle groups are as involved in your day-to-day training as your shoulders. 
                        They play a key role in fundamental chest exercises like bench presses and pushups, and they play an underrated row on back day, teaming with other back muscles when you do dumbbell or barbell rows.

                    <h2>legs</h2>
                    <p>Performing functional exercises, like deadlifts, however, will strengthen your legs, glutes and lower body, while developing all-over muscle and mobility.
                         Remember, core strength supports the body in almost every movement. And the deadlift – the King of Exercises – is the key core strength building movement.
